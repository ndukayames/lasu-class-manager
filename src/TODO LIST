===================================================================
IMPROVEMENTS?HACKS

1. Use "SELECT IN"
2. Instead of different HOCs to create a class, the main HOC will create, then the other HOCs will join the class with the click of a button and the details will be sent to the database, as if they sent the details

NEXT THING TO do

I'm trying to setup a system that disallows other HOCs to schedule a class until the main HOC does, at the moment i've been able to disable all options to schedule a class for external HOC, now main HOCs can't create a class too because i've hidden the view should in case the class hasn't started [done]

Now I have to open up the menu for main HOCs to schedule a class and still hide it from external HOC [done]

FIX class schedule 1hour time difference to calculate the minutes, ie the difference between 11:29pm and 12:29pm is not seen as 1hr
